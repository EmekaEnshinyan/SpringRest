mvnw and mvnw.cmd - 
These are Maven wrapper scripts. You can use these scripts
to build your project even if you don’t have Maven installed on your machine.
 pom.xml—This is the Maven build specification.

TacoCloudApplication.java—
This is the Spring Boot main class that bootstraps
the project. 

application.properties—
This file is initially empty, but offers a place where you
can specify configuration properties.

static—
This folder is where you can place any static content (images, stylesheets,
JavaScript, and so forth) that you want to serve to the browser. It’s initially
empty.

templates—
This folder is where you’ll place template files that will be used to
render content to the browser. It’s initially empty, but you’ll add a Thymeleaf
template soon.

TacoCloudApplicationTests.java—
This is a simple test class that ensures that
the Spring application context loads successfully. You’ll add more tests to the
mix as you develop the application.

Maven - 
Maven is used for project build automation using Java. It helps you map out how 
a particular software is built, as well as its different dependencies. 
It uses an XML file to describe the project that you are building, the 
dependencies of the software with regards to third-party modules and parts, the 
build order, as well as the needed plugins. Maven will download libraries and 
plugins from the different repositories and then puts them all in a cache on your local machine. 

@SpringBootConfiguration—
Designates this class as a configuration class.
Although there’s not much configuration in the class yet, you can add Javabased
Spring Framework configuration to this class if you need to. This annotation
is, in fact, a specialized form of the @Configuration annotation.

@EnableAutoConfiguration—
Enables Spring Boot automatic configuration.
We’ll talk more about autoconfiguration later. For now, know that this annotation
tells Spring Boot to automatically configure any components that it thinks
you’ll need.

@ComponentScan—
Enables component scanning. This lets you declare other
classes with annotations like @Component, @Controller, @Service, and others,
to have Spring automatically discover them and register them as components in
the Spring application context.

Thymleaf - 
In web applications Thymeleaf aims to be a complete substitute for JavaServer 
Pages (JSP), and implements the concept of Natural Templates: template files 
that can be directly opened in browsers and that still display correctly as 
web pages.
